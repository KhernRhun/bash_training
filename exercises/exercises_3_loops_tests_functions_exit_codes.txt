1\) Run `typeset -f`. Find out how this relates to `declare -f` by looking at the bash man page (`man bash`).

2\) alias `alias`, override `cd`. Try and break things. Have fun. If you get stuck, close down your terminal, or exit your bash shell (if you haven’t overridden exit!).
And yes, you can alias alias. EXERCISE

1\) Research all the unary operators, and try using them (see `man bash`)
2\) Write a script to check whether key files and directories are in their
correct place.
3\) Use the `find` and `wc` commands to count the number of files on your
system and perform different actions if the number is higher or lower than what
you expect.

1\) Find a real program that uses getopts to process arguments and figure out what
it’s doing.

2\) Write a while loop to check where a file exists every few seconds. When it does,
break out of the loop with a message.

1\) Look up under what circumstances git returns a non-zero exit code.

2\) Look up all the ‘special parameters’ and see what they do. Play with them. Research under what circumstances you might want to use them.
