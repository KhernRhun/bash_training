1\) Write a shell script that you can’t escape from (the machine it runs on must
not be overloaded as a result!) in the terminal

2\) Try and escape from the shell script you created in 1)

3\) Ask everyone you know if they can escape the shell script

4\) If no-one can escape it, send it to the author :)

5\) Research the other 'special' signal traps. Use `man bash` for this.

1\) Learn how to do all of the above things in sed too. This will take some research and time.
2\) Learn how to do all of the above in perl. This will also take some research and time!
3\) Construct a useful echo that has a double-quoted string with a single-quoted string inside, eg one that outputs:

He said 'I thought she'd said "bash was easy when $s are involved" but that can’t be true!'


1\) Write autocomplete scripts for already-existing programs you use often.

2\) Look for autocomplete scripts on GitHub, and install and use them locally.

3\) Read the bash manual section and figure out what all the `COMP_` variables
store when autocompleting. Write example programs to use them.
