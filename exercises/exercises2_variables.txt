Pipes and Redirects
===================

1) Force an error on the terminal and capture the output, working out if the error was sent to standard output or standard error.

2) Create a folder with several text files in it, and then 'cat' them to a single file. Then 'cat' them again, but append to the file so there are two copies of all files in the new file.

Variables
=========

1) Create a variable 'STILL_THERE' that will persist if you run 'bash' in your terminal and then try to echo it

2) Take the output of `env` in your shell and work out why each item is there and what it might be used by. You may want to use `man bash`, or use google to figure it out. Or you could try re-setting it and see what happens.

3) Create a variable containing just an asterisk, and echo that variable so that only an asterisk is shown.
